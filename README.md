# CMSC495
Project for CMSC 495<br>
Dan's updates so far, with some working integration between the Assessment Module and the Code Tracing Question Module.  This is implemented via some test data that is pulled in together in the CMSC495Final file (pseudo-main file until the GUI is available).
Josh's updates are in now too accounting for the instruction module and one of the other assessment types.  One more assessment type to go and the GUI and we should be able to start integration work.
